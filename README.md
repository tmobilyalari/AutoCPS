# AutoCPS
32.2 CPS and 161 Clicks in 5 Seconds
If you press the "<" button, you will exit the application. If you press the "X" key, you will have stopped or started.
And again, if this is a problem, change the "delay" value in the code.
If the delay increases, the instant click (CPS) will decrease. eg. It takes 32.2 seconds/click (cps) at 0.02 latency.
